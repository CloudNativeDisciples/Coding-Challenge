# BRIEF 

Imagine that you meet with a small multi-player geo-location based mobile gaming startup (think Pokemon Go) in the early stages of their operations. Basically at this stage they have is a minimum viable product. Currently their backend architecture uses a LAMP stack with MySQL, Apache and PHP running on few virtual machines provided by some VPS hosting company. For mobile they are using a cross-platform mobile framework. 

Like many mobile gaming start-ups they are confident that they will be the next big thing and they expect significant, rapid, yet un-quantified growth in the next few months. They are concerned about: technology stack and roadmap - particularly how they can add more advance mobile gaming features such as push notifications, analytics, user data sync, SSO and most importantly game personalisation and recommendation based on the user behaviour. 

They are also very concerned about investing too much too soon or not enough too late. They want to build a technology stack and roadmap which can scale and meet high performance and throughput making the user experience in the mobile app a very low latency affair.

# OBJECTIVE 
Recommend a manageable, secure, scalable, high performance, efficient, elastic, highly available, fault tolerant and recoverable application architecture that allows the startup to organically grow. The architecture should specifically address the requirements/concerns as described above using various Amazon Web Services, or Google Cloud or any other third party services.

# DELIVERABLES 
A PDF document no greater than three or four pages in length that clearly and succinctly present an analysis of the startups requirements and the proposed architecture diagram. Clearly state all assumptions made during the design and explicitly state the referenced Amazon Web Services. Try to cover as many details as possible in this PDF document.
