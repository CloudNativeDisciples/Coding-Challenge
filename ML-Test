# ML Test

## Problem Description

Given a set of tweets, use any programming languages/libraries to build a binary classifier to predict the sentiment.

## Scoring Points

- Algorithms. Baseline would be Naive Bayes; Get bonus for Perceptron model; More rewards with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or Long-short-term-memory (LSTM); Even more with the attention model or combinations of CNN and LSTM.
- Tools. SKlearn is the baseline. Use Tensorflow, Caffe, CNTK, Torch, Theano or Keras for more bonus.
- Clarity of the approach. Any reasoning behind the selection of tools/algorithms/preprocessing/postprocessing/tuning.
- Presentation of results.
- Bonus for incorporating Word2Vec
